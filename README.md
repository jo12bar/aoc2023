# `aoc2023` - My solutions to [Advent of Code 2023][aoc2023-website]

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023][aoc2023-website]
challenges. They're implemented in Rust, within the framework of a highly
over-complicated TUI app built with [`ratatui`][ratatui], following the
[`ratatui` async template][ratatui-async-template].

And yes, I did start very late. This is what happens when your job is not programming.
